# Password_Generator
The password generator was an activity where an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria had to be created. This was an extremely tidious project where it required a lot of brain power to create functions to call out specific commands. Though it was a simple concept, putting it together and typing it out in Javascript language was very different. 


## Process

Pseudo coding was extremely helpful in creating a layout of what I wanted to accomplish from this password generator. I tried several different codes on how to generate a random password. Below is part of the code that took a lot of Googling and trial and error to finally get a function to generate a random password based on user-selected criteria.

I never thought I would be so happy to see random characters/numbers generated. It was extremely satisfying to see the password generated below:
